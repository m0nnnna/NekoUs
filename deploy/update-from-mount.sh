# Updates this production deployment from images/configs built elsewhere and dropped onto a
# shared mount (Windows dev machine's Y:\nekous-deploy, mounted here at $SOURCE_DIR) — the
# "build on a real dev machine, ship the image, don't rebuild on the small production box" flow
# docker-compose.yml's own top comment refers to. Run this ON the production machine itself,
# as a user with docker permissions:
#
#   sh /opt/nekous/deploy/update-from-mount.sh
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. Copies the current deploy/docker-compose.yml and deploy/livekit.yaml from the mount into
#      /opt/nekous/deploy/ — NOT .env (that holds this deployment's real secrets and is never
#      touched here) and NOT the nginx/ examples (static reference files, not loaded by anything).
#   2. `docker load`s the three prebuilt images (web, token-server, push-gateway) straight from
#      the mount — no need to duplicate multi-hundred-MB tarballs onto local disk just to load
#      them once.
#   3. Recreates the compose stack from those freshly loaded `:latest`-tagged images (no
#      `--build` — see docker-compose.yml's comment on why a plain `up -d` picks up a loaded
#      image without rebuilding).
#
# Safe to re-run. Does not touch livekit's own persisted state, .env, or anything under
# /etc/letsencrypt. Does not prune old images afterward — do that by hand
# (`docker image prune -f`) once you've confirmed the new containers are healthy.
