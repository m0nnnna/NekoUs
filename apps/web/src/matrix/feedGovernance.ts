/**
 * A Space's authority over its members' feed rooms.
 *
 * A feed room isn't a Space child and its owner is the only one with power in it (feed.ts), so
 * nothing the Space does reaches it on its own: banning someone from the Space left them joined to
 * every feed they'd opened — still reading a private Space's posts, still commenting — and a
 * Space moderator couldn't take down an abusive post or comment. Only the owner can change a feed
 * room, so the **owner's client** keeps each of their feeds in line with its Space:
 *
 * - **Membership.** Anyone joined to the feed who is no longer joined to the Space is kicked. A
 *   kick is enough: the restricted join rule only admits Space members, so they can't come back
 *   without rejoining the Space first.
 * - **Moderators.** Whoever can delete messages in the Space (its `redact` level; creators too, on
 *   room version 12) gets power level 50 in the feed: enough to delete posts and comments and to
 *   kick, not enough to post (100) or to change the room — every state event is raised to 100 here,
 *   so a moderator can't make a private Space's feed world-readable or rewrite its feed marker.
 *   Someone who stops being a Space moderator is taken back out.
 * - **Visibility.** History visibility follows the Space being listed or not, as soon as the Space
 *   changes rather than the next time the owner happens to post.
 *
 * This runs while the owner has Purrlor open, so a ban lands in each feed when its owner is next
 * online. Until then the reading side hides comments from anyone who has left or been removed
 * from the Space (isRemovedFromSpace), so a removed member stops being visible straight away.
