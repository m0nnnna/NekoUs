 * Discord-style profile extras Matrix's own global profile has no room for (it's just
 * displayname + avatar_url) — a bio, a banner image, and whether the current avatar is animated
 * (so Avatar.tsx knows to skip thumbnailing it, see below). Built on MSC4133 "extended profiles"
 * (https://github.com/tcpipuk/matrix-spec-proposals/blob/main/proposals/4133-extended-profiles.md),
 * which matrix-js-sdk already has full native support for (getExtendedProfile,
 * setExtendedProfileProperty, etc.) — this module is just Purrlor's namespaced keys on top of
 * that, not a new protocol. Custom status text already exists as a *real* Matrix feature
 * (presence's `status_msg`, see matrix/account.ts's updateOwnPresence) and isn't duplicated here.
 *
 * Unlike a room/Space state event, these are global — the same bio/banner/animated-avatar show
 * up in every room and DM, exactly like Discord's one profile — but Matrix has no live-sync
 * mechanism for extended-profile changes (unlike displayname/avatar_url, which piggyback on
 * `m.room.member`), so there's no way to push an update to everyone watching in real time.
 * Callers refetch on demand (opening a profile) rather than expecting live reactivity.
