/**
 * Likes and comments on posts — both live in the post's own feed room, related to the post.
 *
 * - **A like** is an ordinary `m.reaction` with the ❤️ key, so any Matrix client sees it as a
 *   heart reaction. Un-liking redacts it.
 * - **A comment** is `xyz.nekous.comment`: post-shaped content (text, formatting, media — the same
 *   `readPostContent`/`toEventContent` as a post) with an `m.reference` relation to the post. Its
 *   own event type for the same reasons a post has one (feed.ts): it notifies nobody by default,
 *   and a feed room peeked from another client shows no chat log. The thread is flat; a comment can
 *   answer another comment (`xyz.nekous.reply_to`), and then it also names that comment's author
 *   in `m.mentions` — which is what notifies them: the spec's built-in `.m.rule.is_user_mention`
 *   rule matches `m.mentions` on any event type, custom ones included (checked on Continuwuity:
 *   a reply to Bob reaches Bob's push gateway, a plain comment beside it doesn't). Only the person
 *   replied to is notified, never everyone in the thread. Feed rooms leave `events_default` alone,
 *   so anyone who has joined the room can comment; only posting is gated.
 *
 * **Reading** needs no membership: `/relations` answers a non-member for a world-readable feed
 * (Global, public Spaces) — checked against Continuwuity. Likes and comments are read separately
 * (filtered by relation and event type), so that a thread of any length stays cheap:
 *
 * - **Comments** come newest first, a page at a time: a card reads one page, and older pages are
 *   fetched only when someone scrolls back to them. Nothing is dropped; it's just not read yet.
 * - **Likes** are read to the end, up to a cap, and reported as "1000+" past it. They're small
 *   events, but a hugely-liked post shouldn't hold its card up for dozens of requests.
 *
 * **Why older pages don't use `/relations` tokens.** Continuwuity's `/relations` pages backwards
 * wrong: its `next_batch` steps back one event instead of one page (asking for 50 at a time over
 * a 130-comment thread returns 130–81, then 129–80, then 128–79…), it caps a page at 100 whatever
 * the `limit`, and paging forwards returns nothing. Its first page is right, though, so that's
 * all this reads from `/relations`. Anything older comes from the room's own timeline instead:
 * `/context` gives a position just before the oldest relation loaded, and `/messages` pages
 * backwards from there filtered to the one event type — pagination every client relies on, and
 * checked to walk the same 130-comment thread 80–51, 50–21, 20–1 exactly. It stops at the post,
 * since nothing can relate to a post from before it existed. Standard endpoints only, so it works
 * the same on Synapse. **Writing** needs membership, so liking or commenting joins the feed room
 * first (anyone for a profile feed; only that Space's members for a Space feed, by its restricted
 * join rule).
 *
 * A redacted like or comment still comes back from `/relations` — with empty content and
 * `unsigned.redacted_because` — so everything below counts only relations that still carry their
 * `m.relates_to`.
